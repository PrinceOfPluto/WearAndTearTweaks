# Railroader - Pluto's Wear and Tear Tweaks
Changes the wear and tear rate of locomotives from 1% per 100 miles to 5% per 100 miles and overhaul mileage from 5,000 miles to 1,000. Rolling stock like coaches remain at 5% and 5,000.

Railroader 2024.4.0 initially released with wear and tear rates of 5% per 100 miles and overhaul mileage of 1,000.

Railroader 2024.4.1 contained a hotfix that changes the rates to the aforementioned 1% per 100 miles and overhaul mileage of 5,000.

This mod aims to have the locomotives continue to require more frequent repair and overhaul as in 2024.4.0 while making sure other rolling stock like coaches or logging cars remain balanced to the rates in 2024.4.1.
